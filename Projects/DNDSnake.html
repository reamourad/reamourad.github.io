                    <p>
                        Each character comes with its own set of strengths, making character selection a critical part of your strategy. Do you opt for the expensive fighter whose abilities go beyond powerful or the cleric who tries its best to keep his life. Or maybe, youâ€™re just a normal citizen with no distinct abilities.

                    While collecting valuable points, you'll have the opportunity to strategically allocate those points to enhance your character's abilities. Whether it's buffing your points, decreasing the length of your snake, or gaining special powers like invincibility, the decisions you make will impact your gameplay.
