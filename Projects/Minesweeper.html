        Classic Minesweeper, but with a twist! The numbers disappeared and you have to use your knowledge of minesweeper to find out another way to win the game. There's currently 3 levels in this game with the first one being normal MineSweeper. I also added the choice to create your own custom grid. This game was created for my school Game Jam and got first place.

            <h1>Time Management</h1>
            <p>
                When I decided to participate in the Game Jam, there were only 2 days left until we had to submit our final version. I didn't have the time to complete everything that I wanted to create, so I decided to prioritize. Instead of going right into code, I took some time to brainstorm and decide on the core feature of the game. This helped me make sure that the code was structured in a way that was easy to customize (different levels) and avoid redundancy.

            <h1>Level Design</h1>
            <p>
                Everyone knows how to play Minesweeper and coding the classic one would not be very original. So, I decided to design a new way of playing Minesweeper. There is no more number to help you figure it out. It's your job to find out what these new signs mean!

            <h1>Custom Grid</h1>
            <p>
                On top of having a new way to play the game, I decided to challenge myself (and my players) with the normal Minesweeper but with a custom grid. You get to choose the difficulty of your puzzle!
