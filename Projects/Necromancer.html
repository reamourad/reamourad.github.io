            Necromancer is a game based on the theme “Sacrifice Must Be Made”. It’s a roguelite turn-based game where you have to kill creatures to get access to “treasure”. To open those treasures you’ll have to give away your most precious resources: your life points. In exchange, you will get a new random spell. The goal is very simple: get through the dungeon without dying by skillfully exchanging life points for a chance of more powerful spells, just make sure you don’t run out of mana.

                    <h1>Teamwork and deadlines</h1>
                    <p>
                        One of the main goals of this game was to learn to create a complex game in a team with a very tight deadline. To be able to achieve that, me and the 2 other developers in my team decided to use various tools to make sure we were on the same page and were able to deliver our game on time. Some of those tools include a very thorough brainstorm on Miro, targeting our target market with user stories and based on that creating various tasks on our Trello.

                <h1>Random and Procedural Generation</h1>
                <p>
                    To make this game into a true roguelite, we decided to add as much randomness as possible. Whenever the game is launched, it will add a random amount of rooms in a random location with a random enemy that has a random amount of life. Whenever the enemy dies, the treasure price is randomly set and if opened gives a random spell. This means you could give an insane amount of life for a very mediocre spell.

                    <h1>Inheritance                    </h1>
                    <p>While making this video game, since there was a huge amount of randomness, we focused a lot on the concept of inheritance. For example, all our cards inherited from our BaseCard script which made the code way simpler and easier to navigate. Our BaseCard holds the name of the card, its image, its description, its abilities and the amount of mana to use it. Once this is set as a ScriptableObject, the cards are easily customizable without further coding. </p>

                <p>
                    To make sure that our game was accessible to everyone we coded our game with the idea that it should be easy for the user to change any input and should have basic input for computer and console. To do that, we decided to use the new input system of Unity.

                    <p>We wanted our player to be able to make some amount of choice, so we implemented a Skill Tree that let our player be able to choose the path that they want. Everytime they kill an enemy they get one skill point and could buy any unlocked skill they want. The skills boosts either your life points, your luck, your mana or your attack damage and stay even after you die.
