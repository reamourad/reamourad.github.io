            This is a clone of the famous game Vampire Survivor. It’s a roguelike shoot em’ up game where your goal is to survive for the longest amount of time while monsters keep coming at you. If you gather material to level up and upgrade your abilities strategically, maybe you’ll have a chance to defeat our final boss.

                    <p>
                        When you start the game, you only have access to one character: Julius. You can use coins to unlock the second character, June. June is a fire mage that shoots fireballs, he has better health and speed then Julius.

                </h1>
                <p>
                    Everytime you kill a monster, one of three things can drop, a mana point, a coin, a red potion that heals 2 health, a blue potion that heals 1 health and a magnet that gathers every mana point around you. Most of the time, a mana point will drop (80% chance) and those points go towards the mana level on top of the screen. Each time you reach a new level, the amount of mana needed to level up goes up. For the monsters, they come in waves which become increasingly difficult overtime and after a certain amount of time, a final boss spawns.

                    <p>
                        Once you level up, you get 3 random choices of abilities from a pool of 6 abilities, it can either be a new weapon (energy ball, scythe, katana or fireball) or a passive ability(damage or health). Those abilities become increasingly better the more you level them up.

                <p>
                    The final boss has two distinct abilities. The first one is when he’s close enough to you he’ll swing his sword at you and I’ve added a shader that makes his aura shine blue when he’s doing this attack. The second one captures your position and teleports a hand from above to attack you, the aura of the boss for this one becomes red.

                        To empower the player, they have the opportunity to discover coins during their gameplay, which they can then trade in for various buffs. This helps ease the game's difficulty over time, allowing players to steadily increase their strength and speed.
